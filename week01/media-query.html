			<p>
				"And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed
				and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For
				behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual;
				and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into
				heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of
				never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are
				true; for the Lord God hath spoken it."
